# Web Push Notifications Implementation using Node.js and Service Workers

This repository contains an application that demonstrates how to implement web push notifications using Node.js and Service Workers.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Node.js and JavaScript
- Familiarity with Service Workers and web push notifications

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Generate your VAPID keys using a tool like `web-push` or any other suitable method.
5. Update the VAPID keys in the `index.js` file with your own keys.
6. Start the server using `npm start`.
7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Implementation Details
- **Client Side:** The client-side code is written in JavaScript and includes a Service Worker (`worker.js`) responsible for handling push notifications.
- **Server Side:** The server-side code is written in Node.js and uses the `web-push` library to send push notifications to subscribed clients.
- **VAPID Keys:** The application uses VAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) keys for secure communication between the server and the client.

## Usage
1. Upon opening the application in your browser, you will be prompted to subscribe to push notifications.
2. Click on the "Allow" button to subscribe.
3. Once subscribed, you will receive a confirmation message.
4. To send a test notification, use the provided interface or trigger a notification from the server-side code.
